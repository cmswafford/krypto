  <h2>How To Play</h2>
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <div id="rules">
    <p>Each game has one target number and five low numbers. The target number ranges between 30 and 50. The low numbers are between 1 and 20. Numbers cannot be used more than once.</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to create a mathematical equation using each of the five low numbers exactly once. The result of this equation must have the same result as the target number.</p>
    <p>You may use the basic algebraic operators (+, -, *, /) as well as exponents. Use the caret notation (^) to indicate an exponent.</p>
    <p>Factorial function is allowed!</p>
    <p>Taking roots is also permissable, and the numerator is given "for free". For example, if you have a 16 and 2, you can get to 24 by typing (16^(1/2))! which of course equates to 4 factorial.</p>
    <p>There are 15,504 different hands of low numbers and 325,584 possible games.</p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul id="tips">
    <li>If you have left over numbers try to use them to create 1 to use for multiplication.</li>
    <li>Recognize target squares 36 and 49 then aim for a solution of 6<sup>2</sup> or 7<sup>2</sup> respectively.</li>
  </ul>
